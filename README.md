This is a repository about my repositories. 

I noticed some Github repositories serve as references, guides or storage. So it's only right I have a respository that describes me and my repositories.

## Overview of projects
I tend towards uploading open source code for projects at ver 0.4.0 at the very earliest. At the moment (6/10/2015), I don't have such repositories. These projects are typically related to my interests. 

## Interests
I'm interested in data, humans, and programming. I also love implementing and appreciating great design. 

tl;dr: 
* data processing 
* programming
* product development 
* design

## Experience
* Django development
* NodeJS for tooling
* ReactJS
* d3 for data visualization
